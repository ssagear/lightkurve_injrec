What have I done?
  Learned about MCMC
  Learned more about sncosmo and how to create and inject a supernova model
  Written "documentation" for a class that injects SN, planets, flares, rotation

Problems:
  Would be helpful to go over this documentation with someone to decide what
  lightkurve needs
